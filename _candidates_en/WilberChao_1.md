suggestions:
  - People who desire to properly easily create typeclasses of their own. 
  - People who look for a functional paradigm of a mock of external service in unit test rather than Orient-Object way.
  - People who maybe have a general understanding of typeclasses, but sometimes be confused with other similar code.
  - People who desire a deep understanding of typeclasses.

You may have heard about typeclasses, or even tried to write one of your own and ended up with something weird and messy. In addition to using typeclasses, everyone should gain the benefit and feeling of achievement by programming their own typeclasses in daily code. In fact, we can start writing typeclasses where we are most familiar: in unit tests. The typeclasses are intrinsically a graceful mock of external service with readability, maintainability, and testability. If you are not interested in typeclasses or unit tests, come anyway! I believe you can take away something valuable.
