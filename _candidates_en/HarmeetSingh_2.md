suggestions:
  - 1. If you want to learn Monads and its creation.
  - 2. If you confused for Handling side effects gracefully in a functional way via IO Monad.
  - 3. If you want to Perform stateful operations using State Monad.

Building an application without side effects is close to impossible. Most of the business-oriented applications require side effects to mutate the application state, database transactions and many more. In functional programming, the composition is the key, but to handle the trade-off which comes with referential transparency and immutability is daunting. The inspiriting beauty of Monad allows us to make side effects into pure functions.
In this talk, we'll be exploring the prominent IO & State monad to handle side effects and to maintain stateful operations respectively
