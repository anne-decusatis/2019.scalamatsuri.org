The very nature of a reactive ecosystem is being distributed. Our Industry has seen the rise of various distributed workload orchestrators among which Openshift is the next big thing. In this session, we would explore how Lagom and Akka based microservices could be built, deployed and managed over Openshift. We will also see how things like creating Akka cluster, running database based applications like Cassandra and monitoring could be done on Openshift. The session will also showcase scenarios which would explain how Openshift has a leading edge when compared with other orchestrators.
