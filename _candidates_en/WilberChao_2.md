In spite of the fact that typeclasses benefit our program with ad-hoc polymorphism,we excessively introduce personal principles and conventions.
Programming typeclasses without adhering to their laws would lead to side effects in the code base. Instead of infinitely obsessing over writing more typeclasses, we should take it up a notch by reaffirming our typeclasses are following their laws. We can leverage Typelevel's Discipline library and SBT's customized plugin to ensure our typeclasses are correct. With or without typeclasses experiences, join us to have a better typeclasses understanding.
