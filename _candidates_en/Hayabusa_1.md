There is a special connection between functional programming languages category theory, which is an area in mathematics. The relevant information around this tends to be explained using Haskell, a purely functional programming language. Perhaps because of that, functional programming language tends to be perceived to be more difficult than what it actually is.

In this session, we will explore the category theory terms, and illustrate how category theory is used in Scala.
