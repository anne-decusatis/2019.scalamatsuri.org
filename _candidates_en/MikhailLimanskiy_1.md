Are you getting as much as you can out of sbt? There are a lot of plugins for sbt that cover different use cases, but what if you cannot find the appropriate one? Perhaps you'd like to create your own, but you're worried that it's too complicated?
Lucky for you, in this talk I'll show you that it's not that hard. I'll start with basic sbt primitives such as settings and tasks, and then show you what an sbt plugin is, and how you can implement your own.
Once you know how to build your own plug in, you can use it in all your projects and share it with other people. They'll love you for it.
