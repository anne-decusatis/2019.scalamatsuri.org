FP developers know that ∀ a. a → a has only one inhabitant, but how? 
In this talk you will learn how to rigorously count System F terms 
using type algebra, parametricity, Yoneda & Coyoneda lemmas, 
representable & container functors. We will discover that this 
gives us a new and powerful reasoning tool akin to Theorems for Free.
