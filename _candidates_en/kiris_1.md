**Let's make our own Intellectual Highway!**

At our house, Amazon Echo is used for Smart Home, and we use our own Slack for family communication; but the Bots running on them are my original written in Scala from scratch.

Why did I bother reinventing the wheel, and what am I gaining from this?
Why do I think hacking everyday item is the best way to studying programming over any other methods?

In this session, I will discuss **what I learned about learning** through the following topics:

- Actual case studies and lessons learned
- my own journey through Future and Free Monad etc
- intentional wheel reinvention should be called **intellectual launchpad** instead

Not too much Scala in this talk.
