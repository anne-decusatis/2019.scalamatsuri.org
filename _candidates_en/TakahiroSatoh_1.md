Surprisingly, it's rare to see tail call optimization explained in books.
It might not be familar to those who do not write recursion often.
In fact, I myself have not given it much thought until I started using Scala.

In this session, we will cover the topic for the uninitiated, starting with what stack overflow is and how we can avoid it using tail call optimization. I hope this will help others to understand tail call optimization techniques such as Trampoline.
