Surprisingly, it's rare to see tail call optimization explained in books.
It might not be familar to those do not write recursion often.
In fact, I myself have not given it much thought until I started Scala.

In this session, we will cover the topic for the uninitiated, starting from what stack overflow is, and how we can avoid it uding tail call optimization. I hope it will help to understand tail call optimization techniques such as Trampoline.
