Romande Energie, a Swiss utility company created a lab to explore opportunities for new business models, this talk shows how and why we decided to implement a light-weight monitoring stack while prototyping an IoT reactive platform.
We had to maintain the system and in the mean time try to explain it to the stakeholders (I mean, people with no tech education)!
We firstly displayed the actor model but this doesn't tell much about how the platform behaves, so we ended up with a data flows representation.
Follow our path, starting from a communication tool, we ended with an Akka monitoring tool.
