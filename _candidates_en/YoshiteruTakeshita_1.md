**Note** This is not a technical session.

Have you wondered how ScalaMatsuri is organized?
ScalaMatsuri started its life in 2013 as 'Scala Conference in Japan', and it gradually scaled up to the current conference, which is sixth! In this session, I will go over the history of ScalaMatsuri and bare all behind-the-scenes of how we run the conference!
I'll try to save longer time for Q&A, and I am looking forward to hearing your questions and suggestions!
