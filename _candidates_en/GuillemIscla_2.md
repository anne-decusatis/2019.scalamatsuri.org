When you are designing a RESTful API in Scala, at the very least is a layer that squeeze all your information of the HttpRequest and just deal with your DSL objects of the next layer and forget any raw information of the request. Once you've done that you start wondering how could nicely do AccessLogs, time your requests and many more things. Or maybe your biggest dream is how to get documentation automatically generated out of your code.
Scala tools and frameworks do all that and much more. In this talk I want to share my experience in creating RESTful APIs with different styles and needs.
