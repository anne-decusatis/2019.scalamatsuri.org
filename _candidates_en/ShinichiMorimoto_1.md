Recently there has been many case studies on running online services using Kubernetes in production.
On the other hand, some are using Raspberry Pi as a way of building a Kubernetes clusters at home.

I have tried my hands on a home-improvement project using a Kubernetes cluster with Raspberry Pi, but using Akka Cluster to make it Reactive.

Through this project I've realized how Kubernetes and Akka Cluster, which builds a distributed system using AKka, complement each other, and build a fault-tolerant system.

In this talk, I will illustrate the benefits and lessons learned from building and operating an Akka Cluster on top of the Kubernetes architecture.
