A lot of developers don't use Shapeless because they don't know why it would be useful to them.  Shapeless has many great things out of the box.  I'll show how Shapeless' abstractions like Coproducts and HLists can be used to enhance how you're writing Scala today.  Then we'll talk about how they can be used to replace other techniques you are using and what you may want to go look at next.
