If you've learned for expression and understanding it, but are still having trouble when it comes to actually using it on a web application, or having trouble using both Option type and Try type within a for comprehension, then this talk is for you.

In this talk, we will revisit the basics of for expressions. We will also level up on mastering how to define the types and how to re-adjust the types using examples. The goal is to help those working on their own web applications.
