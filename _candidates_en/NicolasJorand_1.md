Romande Energie, a Swiss utility company created a lab to explore opportunities for new business models, this talk is a return on prototyping experience.
The architecture based on event source and CQRS evolved from a simple MQTT server with an actor streaming the data to a complete system using multiple instances of Kafka, Cassandra, InfluxDB, spark, and Zeppelin. 
We would like to show the evolution of the platform, the prototyping advantage with the Scala ecosystem and the interfacing ease with a third part software for representation of the data in augmented reality.
