We all are aware of the concept of polymorphism and used it in some way or another. AdHoc polymorphism also known as overloading is one type of polymorphism we will be focusing here. Adhoc polymorphism works on different type unlike parametric polymorpism it works on different code base. In Scala we achieve adhoc polymorphism using type classes.
In this presentation I will explain what is adhoc polymorphism, demonstrating adhoc polymorphism using type classes, different type classes and how to build custom type classes.
