Acceptance Test Driven Development (A-TDD) is a development practice in which the expected behaviors (specification, requirements) are defined with test codes prior to providing the implementation that satisfies them.

In this session, I will illustrate A-TDD and its development workflow and demonstrate Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
