Many Scala engineers in Japan learn functional programming using the book 'Functional Programming in Scala'.
In this talk, we will apply the lessons learned from this book to another programming language.

The language I chose is Dart, the language used for a cross-platform framework Flutter, which is gaining popularity in the mobile app industry. It turns out that there's a library called Dartz for Dart (<a href="https://github.com/spebbe/dartz">https://github.com/spebbe/dartz</a>), similar to our functional library Scalaz and Cats. Although its author has been quoted to not recommending 'Functional Programming in Scala', I hope he forgives me for using it as the theme of this talk. lol

I will first introduce the example codes in Dartz, and then explain it in detail together with the tips available in 'Functional Programming in Scala'.
