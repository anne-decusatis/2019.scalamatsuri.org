Scala.js compiles to JavaScript with two major goals in mind: interoperability with JavaScript libraries, and portability with respect to Scala/JVM. With the rise of WebAssembly as an alternative to JavaScript in the browser, one cannot help but wonder whether we could compile Scala.js to WebAssembly, with the promise of better performance. Unfortunately, WebAssembly quickly appears as a siren, and the path to it navigates between Charybdis and Scylla, the threats to interoperability and portability. Come and explore the sea with us, and meet its dangers.
