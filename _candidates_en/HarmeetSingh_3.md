suggestions:
  - 1. If you want to learn Practically use cases of types system via real-life coding examples.
  - 2. If you want to Implement custom Higher Kinded Types and handling partial types via Type Lambda and Kind Projector Plugin.
  - 3. If you are confused with Contra-Variance and Co-Variance rules.

Type System plays an important role in building type-safe applications which reduce immense runtime exceptions and developer mistakes. This sophisticated system is leverage by Scalaâ€™s most famous functional libraries like Scala-Cats and ScalaZ. This feature-rich system allows implementing pure Functional programming on JVM. It is a beast due to its complex syntax as it prevents developers to explore its beautiful aspects like partial types in Scala.
In this talk, we'd be taming the beast and use its beauty to solve real-life issues faced during coding
