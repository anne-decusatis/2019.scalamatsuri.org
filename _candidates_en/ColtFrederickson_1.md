  - "This talk is for 2 broad categories: 1) People who know Scala and have heard of Rust but don't know if that would be a good fit for their next project? 2) People who think going to Rust is a good idea, but don't understand the trade offs of the 2 languages."

Are you thinking of porting an existing codebase to Rust? Porting, if not done carefully, can leave you with a non-idiomatic, hard-to-maintain, mess. In this talk, we will explore my journey of porting an open source, FP Scala library to Rust -- from motivation to pitfalls to lessons-learned. We will map Functional Programming principles onto Rust and look at real- world examples of turning FP concepts into idiomatic Rust!
