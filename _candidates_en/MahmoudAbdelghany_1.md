So everybody knows the Doom games, right? Every new installment brought brand new ideas, and groundbreaking graphics. But more importantly, they brought the source code of the prior installment to the public eye.

Naturally people have played and hacked the code to oblivion, as much as they played the games themselves. 

As such, I (naively) endeavored to port the Doom 3 C++ code to the fantabulous Java. In doing so, I hoped to learn, among other things, more about 3D graphics engines.
What I didn't expect though, was to learn more about software migration, debugging...and even Java!?
