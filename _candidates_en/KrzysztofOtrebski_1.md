During this talk I will show you how we can move the logic from actors into a monad state. We will see the benefits of the logic implemented in composable, side-effect-free way.

The talk is based on a project that keeps all of the business logic inside actors. Our goal is to refactor actors into a monad state. The changes will make the application more testable and comprehensible.
