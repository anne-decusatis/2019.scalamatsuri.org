Apache HBase is columnar NoSQL, widely adopted in industry and research as a Data lake in scaling data processing platforms. As HBase components are written in Scala and Apache Spark also written in Scala as a base, It’s real pleasure to understand the beauty of functional Scala DSL with Spark and HBase. We will also talk about case study: Scaling 30 TB’s and 4.6 billion events per day with Apache HBase as a base data lake solution in integration with Apache Kafka, Apache Spark / Spark Streaming.
