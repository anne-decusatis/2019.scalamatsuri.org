This talk describes a journey migrating our company's core product which is using old technology stack into modern reactive microservice oriented architecture.
You will learn how we use Giter8 in order to create microservices easily and encapsulate common behaviors in an Akka-HTTP based library.
We also implemented an update mechanism for applying template updates on existing microservices projects.
In order to generalize this process, we use JMH, Gatling, Metrics-Scala and other Scala compiler flags.
