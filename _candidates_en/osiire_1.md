DSL can briefly describe complex problems. It can be used as a strong means to solve missing links in various situations. On the other hand, implementing an original language is quite hard since you have to consider many things from parsing to execution. A library called Parseback supports full CFG and is quite useful as it can support some of the main problems in parsing such as ambiguity resolution. In this session, I will introduce some characteristics of Parseback and detail technical points in implementing DSL using Scala.
