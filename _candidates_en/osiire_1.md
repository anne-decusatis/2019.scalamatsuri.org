DSL can describe complex problems briefly. It can be used as strong means to solve missing links in various situations. On the other hand, implementing an original language is quite hard since you have to consider many things from parsing to execution. A library called Parseback supports full CFG is quite useful and can support main problem in in parsing such as ambiguity resolution. In this session, I will introduce some characteristics of Parseback and technical points in implementing DSL using Scala.
