Types bring more safety to our code and functional programming allows us to translate equations directly.  In this talk we'll dive into some best practices for providing maximal safety and testability and show an OSS library implemented using these techniques. We'll discuss why it makes so much sense to rewrite cryptography this way. Finally we'll take a tour of recrypt, which is an open source library implementing Transform Encryption, which follows all these best practices and allows easy sharing with Groups and Users.
