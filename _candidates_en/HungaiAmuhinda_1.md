Understanding how reactive applications are executing in a highly distributed environment can be complicated. Looking at traditional log files only gives a snapshot of the whole story and looking at a single service in isolation simply does not give enough information. Each service is just one side of a bigger story. Tracing has emerged as an invaluable technique that succeeds in summarizing all sides of the story into a shared timeline. During this session, we will dive into: logs, metrics and request tracing to troubleshoot and diagnose  production issues for services written in Scala.
